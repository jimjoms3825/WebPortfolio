            <h2>Thanks for visiting my portfolio site!</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;As a passionate software developer, I am thrilled to have the 
                opportunity to share my work with you. My love for technology 
                started at a young age, and it has been an incredible journey 
                ever since. I am constantly seeking new challenges and 
                opportunities to learn and grow, and I believe that every 
                project I work on is an opportunity to push myself and my skillset 
                further. Whether it's building web applications, developing mobile 
                apps, or creating complex software systems, I approach every 
                project with enthusiasm and a desire to create something truly 
                exceptional. So please, take a look around, and I hope you enjoy 
                exploring my portfolio as much as I enjoyed creating it!

                            At Athabasca University I completed a four-year Bachelor's degree in 
                            Computing and Information Sciences with a minor in Business Administration. 
                            In this program I gained in-depth experience in object-oriented development 
                            languages and the foundational principles of algorithms and computation. 
                            I also studied AI, game development, embedded computing, human-computer 
                            interaction, and blockchain technologies. The minor in Business Administration 
                            equipped me with additional knowledge of business operations, finance, and 
                            marketing which helped me approach problems from a more business oriented and 
                            holistic perspective. I graduated with honors and distinction. </li>

                            This course provided in depth knowledge of the foundational concepts

                <p class="white-text">
                    In my free time, I enjoy pursuing a diverse range of hobbies that keep me engaged 
                    and constantly learning. As a game development enthusiast, I love to tinker with 
                    different game engines and experiment with creating my own unique gaming 
                    experiences. I find computer building to be a productive and rewarding activity, 
                    as I enjoy the challenge of selecting the right components and building custom 
                    systems that meet my specific needs. <br><br>
                    Photography and videography are also passions of mine, and I enjoy capturing the 
                    beauty of the world around me through my camera lens. Whether I'm taking photos 
                    of nature, architecture, or people, I'm always striving to improve my skills and 
                    create images that tell a story.<br><br>
                    When I'm not behind a computer or camera, I can often be found behind a drum set, 
                    as drumming has been a long-standing passion of mine. It's a great way to blow off 
                    steam and connect with the rhythm of the music.<br><br>
                    Lastly, I have a keen interest in learning new languages, and Japanese has been 
                    a particular focus for me. I find the linguistic structure to be fascinating, 
                    especially when viewed through an etymological lens. 
                    <br><br>These hobbies keep me engaged, creative, and constantly learning, and I 
                    wouldn't have it any other way.
